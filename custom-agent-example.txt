customer with AI use cases.  I want the result to be sent as an email.

Write topic in a style

I want an multi-agent collaboration where a first agent will take a given topic and generate a 2 paragraph description
of the given topic.  The second agent will take this as input and update the text towards a given audience (children, 
fiction or technical).  The result should be returned.
